          Pleased that everything had gone so smoothly, Shukhov nudged the

        Reading this moment was a bittersweet experience. Especially when you
        read a book that describes a day in the life of a prisoner in a Russian
        <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag">GULAG</a>
        prison camp that ended up killing millions in the 20th century. Soviet
        system relied on these work camps.
      </p>

      <p>
        The historical setting of the book is such that, it is written solely
        with the perspective of describing the life in these prisons. When
        initially released in 1960's, the book provided the first glimpse into
        these prisons. Thus, I ended up reading the book in one sitting and
        tried to postpone any self-reflections that such books usually motivate.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story starts in such prison in 1950's with the alarm bells ringing.
        The morning has no poetic description of a new-beginning, thus already
        making the setting ominous. Ivan, the protagonist, like any other
        prisoner with his own quirks, has been serving a 10-year sentence,
        allegedly convicted of "spying". With two years left in his sentence,
        the description of the day already carries 8-year worth of weight and
        anxiety.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story discusses the hard life of the prisoners and their struggle
        for food, warmth, etc. One interesting thing the book touches on are the
        relationships inside prison. 14 hours work day in the bone-chilling cold
        weather with rations that hardly kept them over malnutrition , made food
        a very important part of their daily struggle. Despite that, there are
        instances that are difficult to comprehend . One such instance is when
        Ivan sews up some surplus food he managed to gain at the end of the day
        in his bed sheet with nearby prisoners in plain sight. He can trust them
        with his food.
      </p>

      <p>
        The day ends with Ivan reflecting and being satisfied and hopeful. I
        loved the juxtaposition of a stormy morning and a hopeful night. The
        book focuses not on a messiah, but the struggles of an ordinary person
        in an extraordinary scenario.
      </p>

      <p>
        It should make us think of the whole range of spectrum human actions can
        be in. From Stalin to Gandhi, all of us are ultimately humans. I ended
        up watching a documentary on Stalin by BBC. That was not a fun weekend
        :)
