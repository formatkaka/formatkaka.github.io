    <title>Essay - Positive Reinforcement</title>

    <h1 class="title">Positive Reinforcement</h1>
    <p class="date">Date - 09-08-2020</p>

    <p>The way a human being develops is a result of many different factors</p>

    <p>
      One thing is clear that people can change overtime. Good and bad is
      subjective. It can change from person to person. We don't want to do that
      discussion. I'm not sure if it's stupid, but we can definitely agree on
      some understanding of a responsible human being. Maybe someone who
      understands their constitutional rights and tries to follow their
      constitutional duties.
    </p>

    <p>
      (Greater understanding on this may be developed by observing animals
      around. It's possible that this essay is utter garbage and does not
      respect evolution and natural growth. Maybe we were never meant to play by
      such rules and are obeying them only because that is how the world turned
      out for us)
    </p>

    <p>
      It is difficult to believe that Buddha or Hitler are born. What I mean is
      that conditions around us also moulds us. Maybe people are born with
      different attitudes. But it is important to consider various
      socio-political, socio-economic, parental upbringing. It's a multi-variate
      problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, human's, like other animals are natural predators. But the phenomenon
      of genocide is not found in animal kingdom. It is very unnatural.
      Exploitation on such a scale is something I find difficult to articulate.
      Consumerism has somehow mutated the problem to something even more weird.
      Agression has been turned to passive-aggressive behaviour. Money, power,
      lack of empathy has played important role here.
    </p>

    <p>
      But coming to the point, one of the very simple things we can do to solve
      this, is positive reinforcement. This is an intagible skill. And generally
      people only need very little of it. A small <i>genuine</i> can go a long
      way in making someone. (Although when it's fake, positive reinforcement
      can be cringy :p )
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe someone like hitler never understood the importance of empathy.
      Maybe because he never received it.
      <b>Who knows, you might prevent the next hitler.</b>

      I plan to read up more on this, some of the resources I've referred and
      some more that I plan to refer
