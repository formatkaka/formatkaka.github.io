          Pleased that everything had gone so smoothly, Shukhov nudged the

        One fine day, I was discussing with a close relative, the importance of
        great orators. The influence they have on people and the range of impact
        that they can potentially generate. Stepping through various such
        orators, we also happened to discuss
        <a
          class="link"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr."
          target="_blank"
          >Martin Luther King Jr</a
        >
        (henceforth referred to as MLKJ). We ended up watching the famous
        <a
          class="link"
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP4iY1TtS3s"
          target="_blank"
          >"I have a dream speech ..."</a
        >
        and I was in awe of the connection he generated with the people. There
        were things that I learned from him. (Alas, didn't focus much on the
        racial discrimination part.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I had read on racism before the 21st century, and also seen how
        it affected generations in Indian popular culture. I still lacked the
        context to fully interpret MLKJ's speech from the perspective of West.
      </p>

      <p>
        The book's protagonist Elwood Curtis, is a well-mannered, intelligent
        and curious kid. An orphan, living with his grandmother in the US of
        1960's, he was always helpful to her. One of the highlight's of Elwood's
        (replace with age), was listening to MLKJ's speech cassette.
      </p>

      <p>
        That speech planted a seed which began to take root. He developed the
        understanding of society and culture with the speech in mind. In such a
        young age, he was ready to make the effort. Going out to protests,
        asking questions (even if only to himself).

      <p>
        Due to some unfortunate incident, Elwood ends up in a so called "reform
        school (Nickel Academy)".
      </p>

      <p>
        The reform school is only good to re form your life into a living
        nightmare. Apart from the mental abuse, to which most of the
        <bold>inmates</bold>
        were habituated, the reform school also focused on re forming children's
        with marks of leather lashes. The reform school reformed you love into
        anger. The reform school were so reformative that they re formed young
        chirpy kids into silent coffins six feet under. They were as reformative
        as Stalin's Gulag or Hitler's concentration camps.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story deals with the struggles of kids against the school's
        authorities. Elwood was denied proper education. They lost their
        childhood and the sense of their being.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite all this, Elwood throughout his struggles managed to remember
        MLKJ's speech and take inspiration from it. Along with other children in
        the school, the story recounts the horror faced by so many.

      <p class="review__section-title">Conclusion</p>
      <p>
        The problem of discrimination has more to do with the person who
        discriminates. The problem is not of caste, color, creed, religion,
        gender. The problem is that we always find a way to divide ourselves by
        falling prey to and not fully understanding the flawed nature of self.
        The lack of understanding causes fear eventually causing acts of
        violence and atrocities. MLKJ and so many others were able to inspire
        change only because they were able to help themselves before someone
        else.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world where people try to force change and become messiah's , such
        servant leaders inspire us to look into ourselves and consequently
        inspire change.

        About the book - It took me 2 days to finish this book, both a month
        apart. I found the pace to be slow sometimes. Some parts felt like
        filler. Also expected to have a little bit more of grandma's involvement
        after the first part.
