> *Pleased that everything had gone so smoothly, Shukhov nudged the captain in the ribs and said: "Listen, captain, where does this science of yours say the old moon goes afterward?"*
> 
> *"Where does it go? What do you mean? What stupidity! It's simply not visible."*
> 
> *Shukhov shook his head and laughed. "Well, if it's not visible, how d'you know it's there?"*
> 
> *"So, according to you," said the captain, unable to believe his ears, "it's another moon every month."*
> 
> *"What's strange about that? People are born every day. Why not a moon every four weeks?"*
> 
> *"Phaugh!" said the captain and spat. "I've never met a sailor as stupid as you in my life. So where do you think the old moon goes?"*
> 
> *"That's what I'm asking you. Where does it go?" Shukhov showed his teeth in a smile.*
> 
> *"Well, tell me. Where does it go?"*
> 
> *Shukhov sighed and said with a slight lisp: "In our village, folk say God crumbles up the old moon into stars."*
> 
> *"What savages!" The captain laughed. "I've never heard that one. Then you believe in God, Shukhov?"*
> 
> *"Why not?" asked Shukhov, surprised. "Hear Him thunder and try not to believe in Him."*
> 
> *"But why does God do it?"*
> 
> *'Do what?"*
> 
> *"Crumble the moon into stars. Why?"*
> 
> *"Well, can't you understand?" said Shukhov. "The stars fall down now and then. The gaps have to be filled."*

Reading this moment was a bittersweet experience. Especially when you read a book that describes a day in the life of a prisoner in a Russian [GULAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag) prison camp that ended up killing millions in the 20th century. Soviet system relied on these work camps.

The historical setting of the book is such that, it is written solely with the perspective of describing the life in these prisons. When initially released in 1960's, the book provided the first glimpse into these prisons. Thus, I ended up reading the book in one sitting and tried to postpone any self-reflections that such books usually motivate.

The story starts in such prison in 1950's with the alarm bells ringing. The morning has no poetic description of a new-beginning, thus already making the setting ominous. Ivan, the protagonist, like any other prisoner with his own quirks, has been serving a 10-year sentence, allegedly convicted of "spying". With two years left in his sentence, the description of the day already carries 8-year worth of weight and anxiety.

The story discusses the hard life of the prisoners and their struggle for food, warmth, etc. One interesting thing the book touches on are the relationships inside prison. 14 hours work day in the bone-chilling cold weather with rations that hardly kept them over malnutrition , made food a very important part of their daily struggle. Despite that, there are instances that are difficult to comprehend . One such instance is when Ivan sews up some surplus food he managed to gain at the end of the day in his bed sheet with nearby prisoners in plain sight. He can trust them with his food.

The day ends with Ivan reflecting and being satisfied and hopeful. I loved the juxtaposition of a stormy morning and a hopeful night. The book focuses not on a messiah, but the struggles of an ordinary person in an extraordinary scenario.

It should make us think of the whole range of spectrum human actions can be in. From Stalin to Gandhi, all of us are ultimately humans. I ended up watching a documentary on Stalin by BBC. That was not a fun weekend :)
