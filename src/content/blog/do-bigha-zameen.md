### THE STORY

For someone who knows a bit about village life or has read Premchand, the title itself should give away some of the plot. The movie is about a farmer Shambhu Mahato and his family. In a country like India, some things are intangible though technically tangible—like jewellery, home, land, cow, etc. People never sell despite the most difficult situations.

"Do Bigha Zameen" starts with a village setting. The farmers are singing their folklore and enjoying in the rain. They are blessed with rain after 2 years of drought. It is nothing less than a festival. Almost feels like the Lagaan movie song (Ghanan Ghanan) was inspired from this.

### CONFLICT AND STRUGGLE

With urbanization and industrialization rapidly progressing, Shambhu's village is not ignorant to it. A zamindar wants to buy Shambhu's "Do Bigha Zameen" (two bighas of land) next to his own, so that he can build a factory there. He tries to strong-arm Shambhu into selling his land. What follows is, I think, the story of every village where industrialization has taken place and how the family struggles in trying to protect their land.

### RECOMMENDATION

Highly recommend watching the movie. The village is beautifully set up, the songs are great, and the story is well-told. It showcases the hardships you encounter. There is absolutely no glorification of poverty. Makes me appreciate the fact that only 3 generations ago, almost many families, including ours, suffered from similar situations.
