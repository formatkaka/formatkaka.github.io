The way a human being develops is a result of many different factors

One thing is clear that people can change overtime. Good and bad is subjective. It can change from person to person. We don't want to do that discussion. I'm not sure if it's stupid, but we can definitely agree on some understanding of a responsible human being. Maybe someone who understands their constitutional rights and tries to follow their constitutional duties.

(Greater understanding on this may be developed by observing animals around. It's possible that this essay is utter garbage and does not respect evolution and natural growth. Maybe we were never meant to play by such rules and are obeying them only because that is how the world turned out for us)

It is difficult to believe that Buddha or Hitler are born. What I mean is that conditions around us also moulds us. Maybe people are born with different attitudes. But it is important to consider various socio-political, socio-economic, parental upbringing. It's a multi-variate problem.

Yes, human's, like other animals are natural predators. But the phenomenon of genocide is not found in animal kingdom. It is very unnatural. Exploitation on such a scale is something I find difficult to articulate. Consumerism has somehow mutated the problem to something even more weird. Agression has been turned to passive-aggressive behaviour. Money, power, lack of empathy has played important role here.

But coming to the point, one of the very simple things we can do to solve this, is positive reinforcement. This is an intagible skill. And generally people only need very little of it. A small *genuine* can go a long way in making someone. (Although when it's fake, positive reinforcement can be cringy :p )

Maybe someone like hitler never understood the importance of empathy. Maybe because he never received it. **Who knows, you might prevent the next hitler.**

*These thoughts are half-baked. So read them and forget.*

I plan to read up more on this, some of the resources I've referred and some more that I plan to refer
